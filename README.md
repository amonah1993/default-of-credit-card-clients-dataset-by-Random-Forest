# Default Payments of Credit Card Clients in Taiwan by Random Forest Algorithm 


Random Forest Algorithm was applied on the dataset, and because the dataset has imbalanced classes, a technique must be applied to fix the issue.

Two Techniques were applied which are SMOTE and Random Oversampling.


The below figures shows Random Forest algorithm with SMOTE

While this shows Random Forest algorithm with Random Oversampling

Random Oversampling technique got better results than SMOTE as shown in the figures
